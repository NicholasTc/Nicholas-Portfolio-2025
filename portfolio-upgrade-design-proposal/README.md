## 2D Premium Design (`2d-design/`)

A modern, polished design focusing on:

- **Glassmorphism** — Frosted glass cards and surfaces
- **Bento Grid** — Asymmetric project layout

- **Scroll Animations** — Staggered fade-in effects
- **Premium Typography** — Outfit font family

### Key Features
- Split hero: Text left, Code display right (3D tilted)
- Floating badges: "Open to Work", "UCSD '25", tech stack
- Glow buttons with hover effects
- Background gradient orbs
- Subtle grid overlay
- Bento-style project cards

## 3D Interactive Design (`3d-design/`)

A futuristic, game-inspired design featuring:

- **WebGL Background** — Animated 3D grid with floating cubes
- **Neon Aesthetics** — Glowing text and borders
- **Cyberpunk UI** — HUD elements, coordinates, FPS counter
- **Rotating Logo** — 3D spinning cube
- **Particle System** — Floating particles rising upward
- **Holographic Cards** — Stats with gradient shine effect
- **Scanlines & Vignette** — Retro-futuristic atmosphere

### Key Features

- Cyber-style buttons with clip-path
- Corner decorations
- Real-time HUD with coordinates
- Mode indicator ("3D Mode Active")

## Next Steps

1. Review both designs in browser
2. Provide feedback on:
   - What you like from each
   - What should be changed
   - Which elements to combine
3. We'll refine the chosen direction
4. Implement into actual Astro project

## Design Philosophy

**2D Design** = Professional, clean, modern  
**3D Design** = Creative, immersive, memorable

Both designs maintain the blue/purple color scheme and can potentially be switched between using a "Mode Toggle" in the navigation.
